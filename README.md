## FAQ

Q: Why not open source the code?

A: Open sourcing is a grace, not open sourcing is a duty. I do not believe that open sourcing this type of software is a good act, whether it is out of interest or other purposes. Your open source code will be targeted by speculators for secondary sales to gain profits, and their sales targets are unaware of the original author. (Especially on Chinese platforms like Taobao, Xianyu, etc.)



Q: Why isn't Archer freely available?

A: To combat the speculators mentioned in the previous question who engage in secondary sales for profit, we have deployed the core code on remote servers. Archer operates on as many as seven remote servers, which represents a significant expense. Additionally, we currently have more than 70 AI engines and are continuously training them without almost any pause, leading to substantial electricity bills. Furthermore, the cost of manual maintenance is also significant, which is why we cannot make it freely available.



Q: Is the Archer service stable?

A: Archer operates on a network of seven remote servers and is developed using the relatively stable `Golang` language. It has been running smoothly for five years now.



Q: Does Archer provide an automatic game mode?

A: To protect your account security, we only offer callable `golang` and `javascript` API interfaces. You can implement an automatic game mode by calling these interfaces.

## Preview

Archer allows you to focus more on the game page. It can directly display recommended information at a higher level in the game without needing to pay attention to any other information. Moreover, its installation and use do not require any complicated procedures. You only need to click on the "ðŸš€" icon to start, without any cumbersome additional operations. This ease of use is unmatched by any other software currently available in the market.

Archer's image display is independent of the game and has no connection with the game itself. They are separate, belonging to software independently developed by Archer. You can think of it as a standalone application. It is designed to be fixed on the topmost layer of the screen. You can use the shortcut key Ctrl + I to configure whether your mouse can click through the software to interact with the game page.

## Assassin Extension

The Assassin extension displays in real time the remaining count of Tiles in the current game, as well as the Discard information of the other players, excluding oneself. The gray color indicates Tsumogiri, meaning the Tile that was just dealt is immediately discarded. This extension will not obstruct your table information; by clicking anywhere on the extension, it will minimize to a floating icon in the top left corner. When you need it, simply click this floating icon to restore the display.

## Milestone:

2024-03-06: We conducted 170 matches on Tenhou with our latest engine against the Mortal 4.0 strongest model, achieving an average rank of 2.3823, sounds pretty good.

2024-01-26: Since we have not yet obtained permission from the Tenhou platform, we may not disclose effective information so soon. We will make the relevant information public when we determine that everything is complete.

2024-??-??: Achieving 10-dan in Tenhou, we will announce the results after some time. Currently, we need to organize some data and cannot disclose it publicly yet.

2023-12-25: As Christmas approaches, we have completed our final test for 2023. This test still achieved the Tenhou 8-dan rank, but the performance was better than in 2022. In 2024, we will strive for even higher ranks.

2023-11-15: Through our continuous efforts, we have successfully reduced the probability of account bans to below 1%, achieving a record of only 7 bans in 9 months.
