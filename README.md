# Archer

Archer是市面上最顶级的麻将AI软件，该软件原生支持Windows、macOS (Intel)、macOS (Apple Clip)、Linux等不同平台，无需安装Docker、Rust、Python等让用户安装繁琐的环境，也不需要用户安装信任任何证书，也不需要用户设置任何东西，只需要在Windows系统上只需要双击启动后点击“🚀”图标即可，在其他系统上也仅需要`cd`到目录下使用`./archer`启动即可，可以说在市面上没有任何一款软件的易用性和强度比得上本软件，并且也是唯一一款不使用mortal的AI软件，经过了长达2年的改进训练已经让kanachan超越了绝大多数市面上能见到的任何私人AI，本软件支持在无UI环境(例如无GUI的Linux服务器上)使用。

Archer is the top-tier Mahjong AI software available in the market. This software natively supports different platforms like Windows, macOS (Intel), macOS (Apple Clip), and Linux. It does not require the installation of Docker, Rust, Python, or any other complex environment setup. Users don't need to install or trust any certificates, nor set up anything. On Windows, you just need to double-click to start the program and then click the "🚀" icon. On other systems, you simply need to `cd` into the directory and start it with `./archer`. In terms of ease of use and strength, no other software on the market can match this one. Moreover, it is the only AI software that doesn't use 'mortal'. After 2 years of continuous improvement and training, 'kanachan' has surpassed most of the private AIs available in the market. This software also supports operation in a no UI environment, such as on a Linux server without GUI.

## Preview

Archer allows you to focus more on the game page. It can directly display recommended information at a higher level in the game without needing to pay attention to any other information. Moreover, its installation and use do not require any complicated procedures. You only need to click on the "🚀" icon to start, without any cumbersome additional operations. This ease of use is unmatched by any other software currently available in the market.

Archer's image display is independent of the game and has no connection with the game itself. They are separate, belonging to software independently developed by Archer. You can think of it as a standalone application. It is designed to be fixed on the topmost layer of the screen. You can use the shortcut key Ctrl + I to configure whether your mouse can click through the software to interact with the game page.

## Milestone:

2024-01-26: Since we have not yet obtained permission from the Tenhou platform, we may not disclose effective information so soon. We will make the relevant information public when we determine that everything is complete.

2024-??-??: Achieving 10-dan in Tenhou, we will announce the results after some time. Currently, we need to organize some data and cannot disclose it publicly yet.

2023-12-25: As Christmas approaches, we have completed our final test for 2023. This test still achieved the Tenhou 8-dan rank, but the performance was better than in 2022. In 2024, we will strive for even higher ranks.

2023-11-15: Through our continuous efforts, we have successfully reduced the probability of account bans to below 1%, achieving a record of only 7 bans in 9 months.
